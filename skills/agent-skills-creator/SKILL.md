description: Guides creation of best-practice agent skills following the open format specification. Covers frontmatter, directory structure, progressive disclosure, reference files, rules folders, and validation. Use when creating a new skill, authoring SKILL.md, setting up a rules-based audit skill, structuring a skill bundle, or asking "how to write a skill."

# Agent Skills Creator

Create skills that follow the Agent Skills open format. Covers the full lifecycle from pattern selection through validation and README update.

## Reference Files

| File | Read When |
|------|-----------|
| `references/format-specification.md` | Default: frontmatter constraints, directory structure, naming rules, advanced features |
| `references/skill-categories.md` | Choosing what type of skill to build (Step 1) |
| `references/skill-patterns.md` | Choosing a structural pattern or need a template for a specific skill type |
| `references/authoring-tips.md` | Writing high-signal content, gotchas sections, setup patterns, storage, hooks |
| `references/quality-checklist.md` | Final validation before shipping |

## Choose a Skill Category

Determine what type of problem the skill solves. Category informs pattern choice.

| Category | What it solves | Common pattern |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Library & API Reference | How to use a library/CLI/SDK correctly | Simple/hub |
| Product Verification | Test/verify with tools (Playwright, tmux) | Workflow |
| Data Fetching & Analysis | Connect to data/monitoring stacks | Workflow, Mixed |
| Business Process Automation | Automate repetitive team workflows | Workflow |
| Code Scaffolding & Templates | Generate boilerplate and project structure | Workflow |
| Code Quality & Review | Enforce code quality standards | Rules-based, Workflow |
| CI/CD & Deployment | Fetch, push, deploy code | Workflow |
| Runbooks | Symptom to investigation to structured report | Workflow, Mixed |
| Infrastructure Operations | Maintenance with guardrails | Workflow |

Load `references/skill-categories.md` for detailed guidance per category including authoring tips and examples.

## Choose a Skill Pattern

| Pattern | When to use | Example | Key files |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Simple/hub | Dispatch to 2-5 focused files by track | `ui-design` | SKILL.md + track files |
| Workflow | Multi-step process with progressive loading | `agents-md`, `review-pr` | SKILL.md + `references/` |
| Rules-based | Audit/lint with categorized rules | `typography-audit`, `docs-writing` | SKILL.md + `rules/` |
| Mixed | Workflow with conditional references | `multi-tenant-architecture` | SKILL.md + `references/` |

Decision guide:
- Auditing or linting against a checklist: **rules-based**
- Guiding a multi-step process: **workflow**
- Dispatching to different tracks by context: **simple/hub**
- Unsure: start with **workflow** (most flexible)

Load `references/skill-patterns.md` for structural templates and skeletons of each pattern.

## Creation Workflow

Copy this checklist to track progress:

```text
Skill creation progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Choose skill category and pattern
- [ ] Step 2: Create directory and frontmatter
- [ ] Step 3: Write SKILL.md body
- [ ] Step 4: Add reference or rule files
- [ ] Step 5: Validate with quality checklist
- [ ] Step 6: Update README.md
- [ ] Step 7: Smoke-test installation
```

### Step 1: Choose skill category and pattern

First determine the category (what problem the skill solves), then pick the structural pattern. Load `references/skill-categories.md` for category guidance and `references/skill-patterns.md` for structural templates.

### Step 2: Create directory and frontmatter

Load `references/format-specification.md` for hard constraints.

- Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Folder name must match `name` field (kebab-case)
- `name`: max 64 chars, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens, no "anthropic" or "claude"
- `description`: max 1024 chars, third-person voice, include "Use when..." triggers with specific keywords

### Step 3: Write SKILL.md body

- Keep under 500 lines; split into reference files if longer
- Only add context Antigravity does not already have (see "Don't State the Obvious" in `references/authoring-tips.md`)
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include a copyable progress checklist for multi-step workflows
- Include validation/feedback loops for quality-critical tasks
- Build a Gotchas/Anti-patterns section from observed failure points — this is the highest-signal content
- Load `references/authoring-tips.md` for content strategy guidance on voice, railroading, descriptions, and more

### Step 4: Add reference or rule files

**Workflow/mixed pattern**: add `references/` folder with focused files. Link each from SKILL.md with "Read when..." guidance in a table.

**Rules-based pattern**: add `rules/` folder. See the rules folder section below.

**Simple/hub pattern**: add track files alongside SKILL.md. Link from a tracks table.

Key constraints:
- References must be one level deep from SKILL.md (no chains)
- Files over 100 lines need a table of contents at the top
- Files are only loaded when explicitly listed in SKILL.md

Advanced options:
- Include executable scripts in `scripts/` for Antigravity to compose (see `references/authoring-tips.md`)
- Add `config.json` for skills needing user-specific setup context across sessions
- Define on-demand hooks (PreToolUse/PostToolUse) for safety gates or observation

### Step 5: Validate

Load `references/quality-checklist.md` and run all applicable checks.

### Step 6: Update README.md

Add a row to the Skills table:

```markdown
| `<skill-name>` | <phase> | <one-line description> |
```

Phases used in this repo: Before coding, Project start, Design, Build, Design/dev, Writing/audit, Pre-ship, Pre-merge, Pre-launch, Architecture, Maintenance, Authoring.

### Step 7: Smoke-test

Install and confirm files appear in the target directory:

```bash
cp -R skills/<name> ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/
ls ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/<name>/
```

## Rules Folder Structure

For rules-based skills (audits, lints, checklists), create a `rules/` folder with:

### `rules/_sections.md`

Category map with impact levels. Format:

```markdown
# Sections

This file defines all sections, their ordering, impact levels, and descriptions.
The section ID (in parentheses) is the filename prefix used to group rules.

---

## 1. Category Name (prefix)

**Impact:** CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM-HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW-MEDIUM
**Description:** One sentence explaining why this category matters.
```

### `rules/_template.md`

Template for individual rule files:

```markdown
---
title: Rule Title Here
impact: MEDIUM
tags: tag1, tag2
---

## Rule Title Here

Brief explanation of the rule and why it matters.

**Incorrect (description of what's wrong):**

[code block with bad example]

**Correct (description of what's right):**

[code block with good example]
```

### Individual rule files

- Named `<prefix>-<slug>.md` where prefix matches the section ID
- One rule per file
- Each file follows the `_template.md` structure

### SKILL.md priority table

Include a table mapping categories to prefixes and rule counts:

```markdown
| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix | Rules |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Category Name | CRITICAL | `prefix-` | N |
```

## Anti-patterns

- Dumping full specification into SKILL.md body (use reference files)
- Creating reference-to-reference chains (keep one level deep)
- Including time-sensitive content ("before August 2025, use...")
- Restating what Antigravity already knows (how to write Markdown, general coding advice, standard conventions)
- Using "I audit..." or "Use this to..." voice in descriptions (use third-person)
- Adding README.md, CHANGELOG.md, or INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md to the skill folder
- Dropping files in folders without linking them from SKILL.md
- Over-constraining Antigravity's approach when specifying outcomes would suffice (railroading)
- Writing the description as a human summary instead of a model trigger with "Use when..." phrases and quoted user phrases
- Skipping a Gotchas/Anti-patterns section for skills with known failure modes
- Hardcoding absolute paths for persistent data instead of using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`
- Storing persistent data in the skill directory itself (gets deleted on upgrade)
